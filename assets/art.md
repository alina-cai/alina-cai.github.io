Here are a couple of fun pieces of art I created using `Adobe Photoshop` and `Adobe Illustrator`.

### Off-White Air Force 1, "Volt"

As a sneakerhead, off-white air forces are a rarity to find. Since I don't actually own a physical pair myself, drawing them is one way to "own" them.

### Fantasy NBA Game Poster

I'm also an avid basketball enjoyer. This was actually done for my senior year accounting summative, but I thought it was cool enough to include here.

### Ninjas on a Cherry Blossom

Cute ninjas on a seemingly strong cherry blossom tree in the darkest of nights. I'm pretty proud of this one.

### Kirito

Kirigaya Kazuto from the anime Sword Art Online. Probably my favourite anime character, hence why I decided to trace him in B&W.

### The GOAT

My role model growing up. This man (Stephen Curry) shoots threes better than anyone else in the league. Need I mention his handles?

### Dylan Wang

Wanted to try something with geometric shapes here. He's also one of my favourite c-drama actors / c-pop stars. Meteor Garden was just a fluke.

### Angel Forces

Did you catch the pun? 'Angel' (the wings) and 'Forces' (because the shoes are air forces). Haha. Nevertheless, more shoes is never a bad thing...
